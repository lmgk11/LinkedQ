# LinkedQueue C++

This is a very simple LinkedQueue. It is a list that has linkes to the next object and has two functions to change the list and one to get it as a string. The two functions is enqueue wich takes one value(int) and puts it at the last position and returns nothing(void). Then dequeue takes no values and erases the first value from the list and returns it.
